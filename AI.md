# AI Tool Usage Record for TinMan iP Project

## AI Tools Used
- **Primary Tool**: Claude Code (Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4)
- **Usage Period**: Start - Present

## Development Increments and AI Usage

### GUI Implementation (Level 10+)
- **Tasks**: Code analysis, JavaFX integration, checkstyle compliance
- **What Worked**: Quick pattern identification, efficient error resolution
- **What Didn't**: Required manual JavaFX verification, Hallucinations, Bad code from poor context size
- **Time Saved**: unsure

### Code Quality & Standards
- **Tasks**: Checkstyle fixes, formatting, import organization
- **What Worked**: Automated style violation detection, consistent standards
- **Time Saved**: 1-2 hours

### Documentation
- **Tasks**: Project documentation
- **What Worked**: Comprehensive documentation generation but still had to verify against our java coding standards
- **Time Saved**: 1 hour

## Key Observations

### What Worked Well
- Code structure analysis and pattern recognition
- Consistent application of coding standards
- Documentation generation following project conventions
- Batch processing of repetitive tasks

### Limitations
- Framework-specific implementations need verification
- Business logic requires human oversight
- Testing strategies need manual validation
- Conventions followed by this module might have be skipped, so had to verify manually

### Overall Impact
- **Total Time Saved**: 4-6 hours
- **Best Use Cases**: Code analysis, standards compliance, documentation
- **Quality**: Maintained high standards with consistent formatting

## Lessons Learned
- AI excels at well-defined, specific tasks
- Always validate AI suggestions, especially for frameworks
- Most effective for repetitive tasks
